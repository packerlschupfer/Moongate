# Development

> Start here if you want to build, run, modify, or debug Moongate.

Moongate has two halves and they're set up independently:

| Half | Language | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobile app** | Flutter (Dart) | `mobile/` | The Android app you install on your phone |
| **Klipper plugin** | Python | `klipper-plugin/` | A single-file Moonraker component that runs on your Pi |

For most code changes you only need to touch the mobile app. The plugin is small and stable.

---

## Quick start (mobile app)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate.git
cd Moongate/mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run                # debug build on a connected device/emulator
```

That's it for the app. If your phone is connected via ADB the app installs and launches in ~30 seconds.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Flutter SDK** | ≥ 3.19 (stable) | <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install> — install via the official installer, not Snap |
| **Android SDK** | API 34+ | Comes with Android Studio. Make sure SDK Platform-Tools and Build-Tools are installed |
| **JDK** | 17 | Android Studio bundles JDK 17 — use that one, not your system JDK |
| **ADB** | latest | Ships with platform-tools. Add `<sdk>/platform-tools/` to your `PATH` |
| **Git** | any modern | For cloning the repo |

Verify everything is reachable:

```bash
flutter doctor -v
adb --version
java -version          # should report 17.x
```

`flutter doctor` should be green on Flutter, Android toolchain, and at least one connected device or emulator before you proceed.

> Windows note: if the Java toolchain complains about `AF_UNIX` sockets, your `TEMP` path probably contains a short-name segment (e.g. `~1`). The repo includes [`run.ps1`](run.ps1) which sets `TEMP=C:\tmp` and pins JDK 17 — use that wrapper instead of plain `flutter` if you hit the issue.

---

## Connecting a phone for debugging

1. On the phone: **Settings → About phone → tap Build Number 7 times** to unlock Developer Options
2. **Settings → Developer options → enable USB debugging**
3. Plug in via USB-C
4. The phone prompts *"Allow USB debugging?"* — tap **Allow** and check *"Always allow from this computer"*
5. Verify on the PC:

```bash
adb devices
# Should list your device ID, not "unauthorized"
```

If it says *unauthorized*, redo step 4. If it doesn't appear at all, install the OEM USB driver (Samsung / Google / etc.) on your PC.

---

## Running the app

### Debug build (fastest iteration)

```bash
cd mobile
flutter run                          # picks the first connected device
flutter run -d <device-id>           # if multiple devices are connected
```

Debug builds are unsigned, slower, and have hot-reload. Press `r` in the terminal to hot-reload after a code change, `R` to hot-restart.

### Release build (production-equivalent)

```bash
cd mobile
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Release builds are signed with the keystore configured in `mobile/android/key.properties` if present, otherwise they fall back to the debug key. CI uses GitHub Secrets — see [Release signing](#release-signing) below.

> The QR scanner only works in **release** builds with the ProGuard rules in [`mobile/android/app/proguard-rules.pro`](mobile/android/app/proguard-rules.pro). Debug builds work fine too; R8 doesn't run in debug.

### Specific entry points

The router lives in [`mobile/lib/app.dart`](mobile/lib/app.dart). Known routes:

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/splash` | App launch animation (2 s) |
| `/dashboard` | Printer grid (the home screen after splash) |
| `/pair` | Add-a-printer flow with QR scanner |
| `/printer/:id` | Embedded Mainsail / Fluidd WebView for one printer |
| `/settings` | Sign-out page |
| `/theme/custom` | Custom-theme colour editor |

> **v0.6.3 services & deps.** `supabase_service.dart` also handles backup **restore grants** (`createRestoreGrant` / `redeemRestoreGrant`) and **bug reports** (`submitFeedback`); the report UI is `features/dashboard/feedback_sheet.dart`, reachable from the drawer **and** the pairing screen. New dependency: **`device_info_plus`** (device model + Android version for reports). To read submitted reports without the Supabase dashboard, POST to the **`read-feedback`** Edge Function with header `x-moongate-debug: <MOONGATE_DEBUG_KEY>` — the secret is a Supabase function secret (`supabase secrets set/unset`), never in the repo.

> **v0.6.4–v0.6.5.** `diagnostics_service.dart` now also captures the Pi's **plugin version** (from the `/status` reply, where `moongate_standalone.py` reports `MOONGATE_PLUGIN_VERSION`) and the **remote/tunnel** connection result, not just the LAN outcome. v0.6.5 adds the first-run **"How pairing works"** onboarding — `_maybeShowPairingHelp()` / `_showPairingHelp()` in `dashboard_screen.dart`, shown once on cold launch (a persisted "Don't show again" flag suppresses it) and always reachable from the drawer's **How pairing works** item.

For a guided tour of how these pieces fit together, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Running the Pi-side services

For mobile-only work you don't need a Pi — `flutter run` against any printer that already has v0.4 installed is enough.

If you're modifying the Pi side, there are now two parts to be aware of:

| File | What it is | How to reload after changes |
|---|---|---|
| `klipper-plugin/moongate_standalone.py` | The Moonraker plugin (pairing, status aggregation, control, heartbeat) | `sudo systemctl restart moonraker` |
| `klipper-plugin/moongate_authproxy.py` | The auth proxy that gates every tunnel-side request | `sudo systemctl restart moongate-authproxy` |

Both ship from the same repo and are deployed by `install.sh`:

```bash
# On your Pi
git clone https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate.git
cd Moongate/klipper-plugin
./install.sh
```

Iteration loop:

```bash
# Edit on your dev machine
nano klipper-plugin/moongate_standalone.py        # or moongate_authproxy.py
git push

# On the Pi
cd ~/moongate && git pull
sudo systemctl restart moonraker                  # if you touched the plugin
sudo systemctl restart moongate-authproxy         # if you touched the proxy

# Tail the relevant log
journalctl -u moonraker -f | grep -i moongate
journalctl -u moongate-authproxy -f
```

To uninstall completely:

```bash
./klipper-plugin/uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller restores the original `moonraker.conf` from the backup it took during install, removes both systemd units, and wipes `~/.config/moongate/`.

---

## Debugging tips

### App-side: logcat filters

Once an APK is installed and you've reproduced an issue:

```bash
# Get the running app's process ID
PID=$(adb shell pidof com.moongate.app.moongate)

# Stream logs from only the app process
adb logcat --pid=$PID

# Or filter by tag — Moongate uses the "MOONGATE" tag for its own dev.log() calls
adb logcat -s MOONGATE

# Camera issues
adb logcat | grep -iE "(MobileScanner|CameraX|camera|bindToLifecycle)"
```

For non-fatal Flutter errors (red overlay in debug, console in release):

```bash
flutter logs                          # picks the connected device
```

### Plugin-side: Moonraker logs

```bash
journalctl -u moonraker -f
# Or directly:
tail -f ~/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log
```

The plugin logs under the `moonraker.moongate` logger — its messages are prefixed with `moongate` in the log.

### Auth-proxy logs (v0.4+)

```bash
journalctl -u moongate-authproxy -f
```

The proxy logs every request at INFO with the verdict (forwarded / 401), the path, and the cause when 401. Useful for distinguishing "the token is bad" from "the path doesn't match anything".

### Tunnel-side: cloudflared logs

```bash
journalctl -u moongate-tunnel -f
# Plus the captured stdout (this is where the tunnel URL appears):
tail -f /run/moongate-tunnel.log
```

## Release signing

For local *debug* and *unsigned release* builds nothing is needed.

For builds that are install-compatible with the official APKs (same signing key), you need both files in `mobile/android/`:

```
mobile/android/key.properties       # path/passwords; gitignored
mobile/android/app/moongate-release.jks   # keystore; gitignored
```

The CI pipeline ([`.github/workflows/build-android.yml`](.github/workflows/build-android.yml)) reconstructs both from GitHub Secrets on every push and signs the APK consistently. Locally-built release APKs use the debug key by default, which means installing them over a CI-signed APK requires uninstalling first (signature mismatch). This is a one-time inconvenience while iterating; CI-signed builds always replace cleanly.

---

## CI / CD

`.github/workflows/build-android.yml` runs on every push to `master`:

1. Sets up Flutter stable + JDK 17
2. Decodes the keystore from Secrets and writes `key.properties`
3. `flutter build apk --release`
4. Publishes the signed APK as a **GitHub Release asset** (`Moongate-vX.Y.Z.apk`) — it is **not** committed to the repo (the ~73 MB binary tripped GitHub's 50 MB push warning on every push)
5. Generates a fresh `APK/latest_version.json` whose `apk_url` points at that Release asset, for the in-app update banner
6. Commits **only the manifest** with `[skip ci]` and pushes back to `master`

So **the only thing you commit by hand is code + screenshots + docs**. The release APK lands as a Release asset 2–3 minutes after each push; the in-app updater downloads from there.

> **Merging a non-release PR? Quiet-merge it with `[skip ci]`.** The build above runs on *every* push to `master` and rebuilds the APK for whatever `version:` is in `mobile/pubspec.yaml`. Merging a PR that **doesn't** bump the version therefore rebuilds the *current* release and **clobbers its existing Release asset** (`gh release upload --clobber`) — silently replacing the published APK with a fresh build (the `latest_version.json` manifest is left untouched when the build number hasn't changed). For deps / config / Pi-side-only PRs, put `[skip ci]` in the **merge-commit subject** so nothing rebuilds; the changes ride into the next versioned release.

`ci.yml` runs `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on PRs.

---

## Bumping a release

1. Edit `mobile/pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   version: 0.9.X+Y     # X = semver patch, Y = monotonic build number
   ```

2. Add a row to the changelog table in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (newest first). User-facing language only — see the existing entries for the tone.

3. Add the version's entry to [`mobile/assets/changelog.json`](mobile/assets/changelog.json) (newest first). This single file feeds **both** the in-app "What's new" dialog (bundled) **and** the update banner's "What's new" overlay (fetched from `master`, so users can preview a pending update's notes before installing). Keep it in step with the CHANGELOG.md row above.

4. **Put steps 1–3 in the same PR** and merge it (releases are PR-based, not direct pushes). A version bump cuts a release and fires the in-app update banner, so the changelog must ride along in that PR — the **`changelog-guard` CI check fails any PR that bumps `version:` without also updating `mobile/assets/changelog.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`**. On merge, CI does the rest — versioned APK + `latest_version.json` update + commit-back happen automatically.

In-app, users running an older version will see the update banner appear within ~30 s of the next launch.

> Feature branches (anything other than `master`) **do not** trigger CI APK builds. That's intentional — unreleased work doesn't get pulled into the in-app updater.

### Plugin version (Pi side)

The version shown in Mainsail's **Software Update** panel is derived from the repo's git **tags** — the same `vX.Y.Z` release tags CI creates — not from a number the plugin sets, so the panel tracks the project release with nothing extra to bump. (The plugin *does* define a `MOONGATE_PLUGIN_VERSION` constant, but it's reported only in **bug-report diagnostics** to pin down the exact plugin build; it doesn't drive the update panel.)

For this to work the Pi's clone must carry tags. `install.sh` uses a **blobless** clone (`git clone --filter=blob:none`) — full ref/tag history, but without the large historical APK blobs — and converts any old shallow (`--depth=1`) clone on re-run. A shallow clone shows `v0.0.0-…-inferred` instead; see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#software-update-panel-shows-an-inferred-version-for-moongate).

> The CI "keep last 3 releases" prune deletes old tags, but the most recent tag is always an ancestor of `master` HEAD, so version detection on an up-to-date Pi always resolves.

## Coding conventions

| Topic | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Dart lints** | `flutter_lints` (see `mobile/analysis_options.yaml`). `flutter analyze` must be clean before push |
| **Folder structure** | Feature-first: `lib/features/<area>/<screen>.dart`. Shared cross-feature code goes in `lib/services/` or `lib/providers/` |
| **State management** | Riverpod `NotifierProvider`. Avoid `StatefulWidget` for app-wide state |
| **Colour API** | `withValues(alpha: 0.5)`, **not** the deprecated `withOpacity()` |
| **Python** | PEP 8, type hints on public functions, zero runtime deps beyond what Moonraker already pulls in |
| **Commits** | Conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `release:`, `chore:`. Bodies wrap at ~72 cols |
| **Pushes** | Push often. CI is the source of truth for the released APK |
