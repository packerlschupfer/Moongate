# Moongate — Setup Guide

## Requirements

### On your Raspberry Pi
- Klipper + Moonraker + Mainsail (or Fluidd) already installed via KIAUH / MainsailOS / FluiddPI
- Internet access (needed to reach the Cloudflare edge for the remote tunnel)
- Architecture: aarch64 (Pi 4/5), armv7l (Pi 3), or x86_64

### On your Android phone
- Android 8.0 (Oreo) or later
- "Install from unknown sources" enabled for the app you'll use to install the APK (browser or file manager)
- The phone needs to be on the same WiFi as the Pi for pairing — both sides of the QR exchange are LAN-only by design

### To build from source (optional)
- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.19 (stable channel)
- Android SDK + JDK 17

## Step 1 — Install the plugin on your Pi

SSH into your Pi and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate/master/klipper-plugin/install.sh | bash
```

This installs:
- The Moongate Moonraker plugin (`moongate.py`)
- The `MOONGATE_PAIR` G-code macro (writes `moongate.cfg`, adds `[include moongate.cfg]` at the top of `printer.cfg`)
- The QR pairing page (`moongate-pair.html` → Mainsail web root)
- The auth proxy systemd service (`moongate-authproxy.service`) — gates every tunnel-side request
- `cloudflared` and a `moongate-tunnel` systemd service (auto-starts on boot)
- Restarts Moonraker and Klipper

At the end you'll see:

```
  Pairing page : http://192.168.1.x/moongate-pair.html
  Remote access: active (Cloudflare tunnel URL is rotated each Pi reboot —
                 the app discovers it automatically)

  Next step: run MOONGATE_PAIR in Klipper console, open the pairing page
  above on a device on the same WiFi, and scan with the app.
```

## Step 2 — Install the app

Download the latest APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate/releases/latest) and install it on your phone.

> Latest public release: **v0.4.2** — the version this guide describes.

---

## Step 3 — Pair

1. In Mainsail, type `MOONGATE_PAIR` in the G-code console
2. **From a device on the same WiFi as the Pi** (a PC, tablet, or another phone — not the phone you're installing on, unless you want to do the manual-code path) open `http://<your-pi-ip>/moongate-pair.html`
3. A QR code appears
4. In the Moongate app, tap **+** → **Scan QR code** and point your phone's camera at the QR — this is the **instant** method (the QR carries the Pi's local address, so the app connects over your WiFi right away)
5. Done — your printer appears in the dashboard as **Local** straight away, with remote (tunnel) access syncing in the background

> The pair page is **LAN-only** in v0.4 by design. Visiting the equivalent URL over the Cloudflare tunnel returns 401 — pairing intentionally requires being on the same network as the Pi, so leaking the tunnel URL can't be used to pair an attacker's device.

**No working camera on your phone?** Type the **GATE code** shown in the Klipper console (`GATE-XXXX-XXXX`) directly into the app. Tap **+** to open Add Printer — the GATE code section sits right below the Scan QR button with two 4-digit boxes and a numpad. The GATE code is the **alternative** method, though: without the QR's embedded address the app has to find the printer on your network, so the dashboard can take a few minutes to come fully online. Scanning the QR is instant.

**Printer behind a reverse proxy (Traefik, Caddy, NPM) or in Docker?** Auto-discovery can't reach it. Expand **Advanced — custom network** on the Add Printer screen (or open the printer later and tap the ✏️ edit icon) and enter the address you'd use to open its web page (Mainsail / Fluidd) in a browser — e.g. `192.168.1.50:7125`. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the full rundown.

---

## Step 4 — That's it

The dashboard tile starts polling immediately. Tap the tile to open the full Mainsail / Fluidd UI in an embedded browser; the connection switches between LAN (when you're home) and the Cloudflare tunnel (when you're away) automatically — no setting to flip.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Unknown command: MOONGATE_PAIR` | `[include moongate.cfg]` is missing from `printer.cfg` — re-run `install.sh` |
| Pairing page shows "run MOONGATE_PAIR first" | Run `MOONGATE_PAIR` in the Klipper console, then refresh the page |
| Tile shows "Connected — Printer idle" | Not an error — the Pi is up but Klipper isn't producing usable status. Common on the Creality K3 when the printer-power toggle inside Mainsail is off. Power the printer on; the tile flips to live status within a couple of polls |
| Tile shows "Offline — Printer unreachable" | Check Moonraker (`sudo systemctl status moonraker`), auth proxy (`sudo systemctl status moongate-authproxy`), and tunnel (`sudo systemctl status moongate-tunnel`) are all running |
| Remote tunnel not showing | `cat /run/moongate-tunnel.log` to see the cloudflared output. Restart with `sudo systemctl restart moongate-tunnel` if needed |
| Tunnel URL changed after Pi reboot | No action — the app discovers the new URL automatically on the next poll |
| Webcam not showing | Confirm Mainsail → Settings → Webcams is configured and `http://<pi-ip>/webcam/?action=snapshot` works in a browser on your LAN |
